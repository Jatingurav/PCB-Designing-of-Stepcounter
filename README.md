# PCB-Designing-of-Stepcounter
I have created the circuit diagram for a Step Counter system, integrating ATtiny85 IC with MPU6050 Accelerometer & Gyroscope, and an OLED Display Module. I have developed a Multi-Layer PCB layout and developed the footprints of the components and generated Gerber files using KiCad software.
